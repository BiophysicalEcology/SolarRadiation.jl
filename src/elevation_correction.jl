    elevation_correction(elevation)

Calculates smooth polynomial approximations of atmospheric constituent correction factors 
as a function of elevation (based on Kearney's modification of the ALTFCT array originally 
from SOLAR.DAT). Input `elevation` is the elevation in meters and can include units.

# Description


The array `ELEVFCT(i, j)` represents the **ratio of the total amount of a given 
atmospheric constituent (index j) above the elevation of interest (index i) to that 
above sea level**. The constituent indices are:

- j = 1: Molecular
- j = 2: Aerosol
- j = 3: Ozone
- j = 4: Water vapor

For j = 1â€“3, values are derived from standard profiles. For water vapor (j = 4), no 
standard profile exists, so only `ELEVFCT(1, 4)` is defined as 1.00.

The elevation index i runs from 1 to 21, corresponding to elevations from sea level to 
20 km in 1 km steps.

This function implements fitted polynomials to reproduce this correction smoothly 
from `elevation` (in meters) using continuous approximation.

# Returns

A `NamedTuple` with the fields:
- `molecular_corr`
- `aerosol_corr`
- `ozone_corr`
- `water_vapor_corr`
